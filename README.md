# Solana Token Minting Application

### **`About`**

This application is created for learning and testing purposes of **Solana** blockchain. It uses `solana-labs` libraries for interaction with the blockchain. Primary purpose of the application is usage of **Solana**'s token program to create and mint new tokens but it can connect to **[Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/)** and airdrop **SOL** tokens.

P.S. Application currently uses only `devnet`.

### **`Use Flow`**

#### Connect Phantom Wallet

In order to use the application you'll have to connect your **Phantom Wallet**. Navigate to Wallet page. If you don't have **Phantom Wallet**'s Chrome extension click on `Visit Phantom Wallet` button, install it and create a new account or log into the existing one. If you already meet those requirements, click on `Connect Phantom Wallet` button to allow the application to use your **Phantom Wallet** account which you can send tokens to.

You can check your current SOL token balance by clicking on `Get Wallet Balance`.

#### Airdropping Solana Tokens

When you connect your wallet, you have the option to airdrop some SOL tokens to it. Navigate to Airdrop Page and click on `Airdrop 1 SOL` button. After a few seconds your wallet balance should be updated.
